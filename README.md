# Reddit to Instagram Automation (No Resize)
This repository consist of a way to automate the process of downloading posts from Reddit and uploading them to Instagram posts. Configured to work with any system with minor edits to the code using the Instabot which is a private Instagram API emulator. This is not the primary method I use. It is a simple version which is more restrictive.
